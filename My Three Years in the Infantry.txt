With the family making tentative plans a for special 2004 Luxembourg trip to visit the places where I saw combat in the WWII Battle of the Bulge. I've been reviewing some of the material I have accumulated in preparation for serving as the guide on this undertaking. My thought was to work up a brief history of that battle and my small part in it, this to serve as background reading prior to next spring's journey but, as I got into it, I started to recall other aspects of my whole experience as a soldier and, finding myself with a lot of free time here in St. Thomas, I decided to expand this into a more complete overview of those times, stretching from autumn 1943 through the spring of 1946… my three years. The initial intent can be served, however, by skipping ahead to page 11.
Stateside Infantry Training
My first real awareness that I may wind up in the service came on a cold December afternoon in Lowell, where I, with some of my family, enjoyed a great concert of folk music by the Trapp family, newly arrived from Austria, with their "Sound of Music" musical and movie fame still years ahead of them. Upon leaving the auditorium we were bombarded by Lowell Sun newsboys shouting "Extra, extra, Japanese bomb us at Pearl Harbor ..... read all about it," etc. We were both electrified and astonished upon learning the details of that sneak attack. On Monday morning the principal of Lowell High School. where I was a senior, piped President Roosevelt's declaration of war into each classroom, a momentous action that soon brought millions of men, and a few women, into the armed services, and which would significantly change the daily lives of every American for years to come.


The first change affecting me directly was my selection of several hastily added choices in our high school curriculum ..... power plants (all about airplane engines), Morse radio code, and meteorology reflected my anticipation of coming military service. Our June 1943 graduation ceremony placed a heavy focus on patriotism in the speeches and music (''This Is My Country" etc.), and, no doubt, we all did a bit of wondering about what the future would bring to each of us.


I don't recall much about that summer. I went to work full time in the family hardware my father having lost his single non-family employee and my older brother, Jimmy, to the services. Shortly after my 18th birthday in August, I received my selectIve service notIce to report to Ft. Devens for my physical. By October I was on my way to basic infantry training in Camp Croft, just outside of Spartanburg, South Carolina.

Infantry Basic In South Carolina


For the next five months, I willingly participated in the Army's well-designed conditioning program whose goal was to convert me from a free and independent civilian to becoming a soldier in every way ..... physically (endless inoculations, dental work, lots of daily drills, weekly hikes, etc), socially (becoming a functioning member of an infantry platoon, adjusting to barracks life with all its different human nuances, gang showers, and toilet facilities, accommodating the rigid dichotomy between officers, non-coms, and plain old GIs like ourselves, learning to go along in order to get along), psychologically (subverting one's natural inclinations and preferences to whatever the Army directs), emotionally (getting over homesickness, accepting some of the Army's brutal approaches, following directions without any questions) and occupationally (acquiring soldierly skills such as close order drill, firing and maintaining my weapon and gas chamber drills, obstacle and bayonet courses, night marches, behavior under fire, etc.) ..... this and much more all combining to enable me and my cohorts to function as properly trained and disciplined soldiers, ones who could and would perform in a predictable way as small, but essential, cogs in a gigantic military machine.


Other recollections of those five months include my learning that southern soil can have a distinctive red color, that one can become extremely fatigued from a 25 mile forced hike with 60 plus pounds of equipment and, on the personal front, acquiring a close friend in Paul Love, a really great guy from a rather privileged (by my standards) background in Pennsylvania. I also earned a few small distinctions along the way. Being extremely thin and wiry, I had the company record for speed in running the obstacle course, I learned that I could be pretty good at firing a rifle, acquiring a badge for excellence, and I also discovered that my innate musical talent served me well in sending Morse code (we were headed toward becoming infantry communications personnel), achieving sending 25 words per minute, which was also the best of our company. This latter accomplishment, which l owe more to genetics than anything else, made me a prime candidate for advanced communications training at the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, which became my next assignment.


Communications School in Georgia
Paul Love, who has also made the cut fur radio school, and I both found school life much to our liking, standing out in stark contrast to our physically demanding basic training. Fort Benning, Georgia, is the site of the Infantry School and is the best permanent post in that branch of the service. Post buildings and barrack were of red brick, surrounded by well-manicured lawns and many shade trees, and there was a large residential area that was as nice or better than most superior suburbs in civilian life. Recreational facilities were excellent, with a handsome theater, post library. and several swimming pools. The officers had their own clubs and pools, of course, while the pools for the enlisted men were segregated by color, as desegregation of the Army was still waiting for the courageous actions of Harry Truman later in the late forties.


We were privileged in other ways, being relieved of having to care for a rifle and full field pack, and having only one brief period of daily calisthenics. Our training focused on more advanced radio procedures, continued Morse code training, and the use of more sophisticated equipment. We operated on two shifts, 6 am to 2 pm, and 2 to 10 pm, spending two weeks on each shift. Having free time in the afternoon was great, and we often spent it in the swimming pool or the library. Some evenings Paul and I would walk around the residential area which, with kids playing around, was as far away as we could get from the regimented Army atmosphere.


As always, I did a lot of reading, remembering many afternoon hours of bunking out when I was on the 6 to 2 pm shift, or, another favorite pastime, watching the airborne troops floating slowly to the ground from their parachute towers, which were close by. Another strong recollection is of the very hot and humid weather. Flat roof areas were spaced out on the third floor of our barracks, and these became our alternate sleeping areas when the barracks were suffocating. About a half dozen of us would lug our mattresses up to the root: spending many hours chatting under the stars and enjoying the cooler night air.


Upon graduating I was given an MOS (military occupational specialty) number designating me as a communications specialist, valued in particular in that it superseded the common infantryman designation I had upon finishing basic training, thus I might anticipate any future combat action to be somewhat to the rear of the front lines. As will be seen, this expectation was short-lived.


Following this training I was given a furlough back to Massachusetts, which was greatly anticipated and enjoyed. I think my parents were distressed that I hadn't put on but a few pounds beyond my regular 125 as I look at old pictures now, I sure didn't resemble any ferocious combat-ready soldier, despite my training. It was good to be home again, however. To my puzzlement, I became one of several Communications School graduates who were re-assigned to commence another infantry basic training program in Camp Van Dom, Mississippi Another BASIC? In Mississippi? In July? Geez!!!


More Basic Training
The word we heard was that the Army was getting a lot of bad publicity about the
number of youths being killed in combat, with much of the criticism coming from Walter Winchell, a well-known journalist, and radio personality, and had instituted a temporary
policy of delaying combat assignments until a soldier passed his nineteenth birthday.
There must have been some truth to this as all of us who were delayed from our overseas
assignment were still approaching that date. And how else could the Army have us
marking time other than to just start us on another basic training schedule?


Aside from my later combat experience, Camp Van Dorn was the worst assignment I had in the Army, being the pits in many ways. The barracks were one-story buildings clad in black roofing tar paper, which made a lot of sense in the searing Mississippi sun. The moisture-laden heat was tremendous, and we slept under musty mosquito bars to keep us from getting eaten alive by the mosquitoes. The training was heavy, and soon we were doing full 25-mile bikes with the regular 60 pounds plus of rifle and equipment. Thankfully, these bikes were started in the middle of the night so that we were finished well before noon, but that's the only concession that I can recall. One sight that remains vivid in my mind was that, while on a night bike, we saw a large burning cross on a distant hill, not uncommon where the Ku Klux Klan was still a local force.


The camp seemed to have an air of vague discomfort and corruption about it, which was confirmed when we discovered that our company orderly room was involved in some kind of bootleg liquor operation. It was off-limits to us, but there was a steady stream of and officers from other units making purchases. Our non-coms were mainly "good old boy" rednecks from the South, with an obvious antipathy to those who didn't fit that picture, often going out of their way to add more "chicken" to barracks life, tales not worth repeating.


Two things helped a lot during that period. We were allowed a weekend pass after completing our first six weeks, and Paul and I spent it in Natchez. We went from touring a couple of magnificent southern mansions along the Mississippi to, that evening, getting more than a little tipsy on beer, releasing the pent-up steam incurred in our unnecessary second basic training. Not an experienced drinker, I can still remember the hotel room swirling around after I went to bed.


The second, and more important savior of my sanity, was being allowed to play hymns on the Hammond organ in the chapel in our company area. This was my first experience on the organ, going over there almost every evening whenever the chapel wasn't being used, even getting good enough to use the bass pedals on the slow hymns.


Sometimes some soldiers would enter the chapel below for a few quiet minutes listening to my playing of the various catholic and protestant hymns. One evening a soldier climbed the stairs to the choir loft, sitting quietly behind me. Soon I heard him crying softly and, upon asking if he was all right, I learned his sad tale. It seems that, though married, he "shacked" up with a girl at a previous post and, since then, had been writing steadily to both this girl and his wife. When his locker began to overflow with their responses he gathered up all of their letters and mailed them back for their safe-keeping. Unfortunately, however, he mailed the package intended for the girlfriend back to his wife and sent her letters back to the girlfriend, and he had just learned that day that his wife was suing for a divorce. He was beyond any hope of assistance from me.


I am reminded of another domestic situation that occurred back in our basic training days at Camp Croft. Crawford, one of our platoon members who was quite a heavy drinker was excited because his wife was arriving by train on Saturday night, enabling them to have one night together before she returned to work. Paul Love and I wished him well as we left for a movie at the post theater on Saturday night. Upon returning after the movie we found, to our surprise, Crawford sitting on his footlocker, shedding heavy tears of regret. It seems that he had several beers while waiting for his wife's arrival and, upon her seeing him more than a little plastered, she immediately stepped back aboard the train without so much as a kiss. So much for his weekend of bliss.


This Mississippi assignment finally concluded and I was shipped up to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, an assembly area for overseas shipment. While there we (Paul and I were still having parallel assignments) got a pass to spend a Sunday in New York City. A highlight was a free tour of Radio City, including witnessing a live broadcast of Phil SpitaImy and his all-girl orchestra, after which I was able to call home. I carefully followed instructions by not telling my parents that I was about to go overseas, though it was self-evident when I told them about the radio show I had just seen. A few days later we were brought over under cover of darkness to board ship someplace on Staten Island, soon sailing out to join a large convoy being assembled on the high seas.


I was not a happy trooper, being disappointed that we were not allowed, for security reasons, to go on deck for a final glimpse of the Statue of Liberty and the skyline, but more distraught in that Paul was not on board, having been delayed for a further eye test. I was never to see him again as, after serving in combat in Italy, he returned to civilian life as a student, from which he disappeared under mysterious circumstances unknown to his family or classmates, never to be seen again. In my follow-up in later years, including visiting his mother in Illinois, it appeared plain that he was somehow a victim of foul play.


Adding further insult to injury, my achieved MOS rating as a communications specialist was now superseded by that, once again, of an infantry rifleman, as that was my latest training designation. Oh, well, I was learning that the Army way was the only way and a hard one at that.

War in Europe
En-route: Life on a Troopship
My recollections of life aboard a troopship at the height of the war may seem as few, this because the experience, from an enlisted man's point of view, at least, is one of utter boredom, consisting of three activities in the main. foremost of which is standing in lines most of the day. working toward the mess hall for each of your three meals.


While most likely to be coincidental, the lengthy procedure in trying to feed several thousand men under limited and crowded conditions seemed deliberately designed to occupy the most substantial part of one's waking hours. The lines would slowly move up one stairway (or ladder, as the Navy would say), out on deck, then re-enter another stairwell, going down into the lower labyrinths of the ship, only to repeat the process at a different part of the ship, and finally to approach the mess hall, announcing itself by the stale odor of steamy food and many bodies. One presented his personal mess gear to the assembled line of servers but, unexpectedly, the mess hall had no chairs or tables, rather numerous stations where one stood while eating from the counter. One could readily understand that when it comes to troopships, every square foot saved meant that more men could to transported, a vital consideration at that time.


The second predominant memory is lite in the bowels of the ship, where vast holds were full of narrow bunks (canvas palettes) five tiers high, upon which we stored our full infantryman's share of equipment and one's limited possessions. I felt fortunate, indeed, to be assigned to a top bunk, as that meant that I could read a book without having to extend my arms into the aisle as those below found necessary in order to have light. There were no portholes and, though stuffy, it was comfortable enough to sack out, with one's book reading underscored by the constant sound of the sea on the other side of our metal shell. During rough weather, the stern would lift sufficiently high out of the water to free the prop (or props), which would send a mighty shudder throughout the hold.


I was most fortunate in having picked up a pocket-book edition (as paperbacks were called then) of Shaw's "Lust For Life," a biography of Vincent Van Gogh. I found it completely captivating, enabling me to be transported mentally and emotionally to 18th Century Holland and, then, to Arles in southern France, a location I got to know very well in my future years.


The third aspect I recall of shipboard life was spending time on deck when the weather permitted, where one felt lucky to capture sufficient space to sit on the deck, and even more fortunate if you had a wall or funnel to lean against. The very vastness of the sea is especially impressive on one's first Atlantic crossing, evocative of long thoughts about what might be ahead, wondering if a return journey would be mine one day, thinking about family, missing the stateside routine of daily mail call (how important and precious it was to receive letters from home, and thrilling to get a package, even though it had to be shared with others), wondering if there were any German U-Boats in our comer of the sea, and similar thoughts.


While we could see only a limited number of ships that made up our convoy, there was some real excitement one day when a distant ship, most likely a destroyer, dropped a depth bomb in response to something that concerned them. We had no further information of what may have provoked or resulted from this event, for all we knew it could have been some sort of drill, but it caused quite a buzz throughout the whole ship.


Our training on-board consisted of calisthenics and, to our pleasant surprise, group lectures on how to be a good guest of Great Britain ..... hey! we would get some months in England! Visions of cozy pubs, friendly girls, downtown London, movie theaters, etc. flashed through our minds while we were hearing about pence and pounds, and how to behave in a proper fashion. Our anticipation really grew once we bad this indication of a coming reprieve from possible combat duty.

Life aboard a troopship
________________
No Pint of Guinness!
There was marked shipboard excitement upon our viewing the English shore, going up the Channel to Southampton. We lined up with our full field packs, debarking and assembling on the dock, looking forward to, presumably, a trip through the English countryside to some inland American post. "Forward march!" then "Left step, march," and we were oil a connecting pier, part of a long line going up the gangplank on a rusty tub that had probably been around since WWI. It turned out to be an old English mailboat converted as a troop carrier. In the English navy style, we were assigned to hammocks suspended between posts, had a terrible meal of watery stew (also in the British military style), then sailed across the Channel under cover of darkness. Daylight found us at Omaha Beach on the Normandy coast, the scene of so much slaughter five months before. So much for merry old England; bonjour Ami!


Omaha Beach still showed a lot of the havoc wrought upon it four months earlier. A vast number of wrecked hulls had been chained together, extending as a long curve into the sea, this to provide a breakwater of sorts. We climbed down netting to the LST's gathered below, gazing up at the steep cliffs adorned with pillboxes on the brim, debarking in the surf. No wonder there was such a slaughter on D-Day. It must have been a scene straight out of Hell, and I take my hat off to the poor GI's that found themselves in such a situation .... absolutely true heroes, every one.


The first sight encountered upon scaling the steep climb up the cliff was a large American cemetery with line after line of white crosses. The majority of those buried there were probably returned later to the states, though many families chose to leave their loved ones where they fell. We bivouacked (made temporary camp) nearby in a mud field that could barely hold the pegs of our pup tents. The next day we were marched to a railhead where we boarded a long line of 40 & 8’s, the troop transport made famous in WW1. 40 and 8's are small boxcars (European rails are of a smaller gauge) designed to hold either 40 men or eight horses. Simply bare boxes with only a couple of small openings once the door was slid closed, no toilet facilities (God help you if you had diarrhea), and nowhere near enough space for all forty men to stretch out on the bare floor at one time. This became our home for the next seven days, spending hours on sidings while other more urgent war material rolled by on the badly damaged railroads. Chow lines were set up only once in a while at these stops, as we were now getting our first extended experience with Army field rations .... K-rations were waxed boxes containing some canned meat, instant coffee, biscuits, chocolate, and a few cigarettes. C-rations were not much different, other than they were contained in cans rather than boxes. We were all given clever little can openers no larger than one's thumb.


Two events related to eating come to mind. At one stop they set up a chow line, the menu consisting of marmalade on bread and grapefruit juice, nothing hot. Saw no Red Cross personnel with their doughnuts and cokes.


At another stop, a Frenchman came by selling a loaf of fresh bread for cigarettes. The bidding soon went from packages to having men pool their rationed cartons. That  Frenchmen walked away with five cartons of cigarettes, the equivalent of $120 on the black market, while the single crusted loaf was carefully divided between the few men who anteed up their cigarettes. No disputes but plenty of envy from the rest of us.


After a week of traveling, our Eurail passes must have run out, arriving near a caserne (former French military post), remaining there for a few days, then boarding another assemblage of 40 & 8's for another five days of scenic touring before arriving at a second caserne, which the Army called Replacement Depots, the GI's "Reppo Deppos." One event remains to this day: several of us were assigned to clean up after some departing groups and, to our delight, we found a full GI can of Spam, something I had eaten many times before in training. Three of us divided and consumed the can on the spot. The reader shall be spared any details on the consequence of this gluttonous endeavor; suffice to say that I have never been able to eat the stuff since.


It is of interest to note that at some point we turned in most of the equipment each of us had carried on board ship, this being the Army's clever way of using the available manpower to transport military supplies. We were issued other equipment upon joining our new units.


Goodbye, Infantry!
After a few days at the second Reppo Deppo. I was pleasantly surprised to be assigned as a radioman (someone must have seen my training record) in an artillery unit (105 howitzers, as I recall) which was in the thick of fighting in the Saar area. The next days were spent running communication wire before various points, sleeping on bins of sugar beets stored in the cellars of the abandoned French homes, getting used to the terrific noise of the firing weapons, and making the necessary adjustments to life in a combat artillery unit. While no bed of roses, it was good to have a line of infantrymen between us and the enemy. I was not unhappy, either, to be carrying a carbine. the personal weapon of artillery personnel, instead of the heavier M-1 of the infantry (a fine weapon, incidentally).


Two events stand out in my memory of these weeks. At one point we were at some forsaken Saarlach village with a single street running up the hillside, houses one against the other, each with an enclosed barn area under the same roof and, inevitably, with a huge mound of animal and human waste mixed with straw in front of every doorway, this being saved for spreading on the fields during the growing season. A couple of us went into one of those barns (I no longer recall the reason for this), to discover that it was overflowing with the dead bodies of American soldiers. Every inch of hay, the barn floor, even the hay wagon, was covered with bodies. Obviously, it was a collection point awaiting the further action of a graves registration unit that would see to their proper burial. I guess the freezing cold weather kept the smell down; in any event, we didn't waste any time in getting out of there. Terribly sobering .... guys my own age ... reminded me of some of the Thomas Brady photographs I had seen of the Civil War, and others of WWI trench warfare. The thought that this was just one small segment of the price that was being paid daily in Europe and the Pacific has influenced my attitude on war ever since....the foolish tragedy of the whole business, the human waste of it all.


The other event of some interest occurred when I was accompanying our platoon sergeant in a jeep, delivering some papers to our headquarters. It was a very dark night and we were going along without any lights. At one point we came close to hitting some kind of barrier, so close that the tip of my carbine, which was on my lap and projecting outside the vehicle, got whacked pretty good. Later, I discovered upon cleaning the rifle that the barrel was slightly bent, which would have presented an interesting development had I occasion to fire it. I was issued a new weapon the next day.
What??? Goodbye Artillery ...Hello Infantry??
I have found it interesting to read in books on WWII history how the Army had suffered such excessive losses of infantrymen at that point in time that they found it necessary to have each non-infantry (service and headquarters) unit to re-assign 10% of its personnel to combat infantry units, some 65,000 men being transferred in late October and November. Understandably, that 10% included the very poorest soldiers (the so-called f-ups), which unit commanders were glad to get rid of. It also included one Bernard Huntley, who not only had one, but two infantry training stints on his record, plus being the newest and least essential kid on the artillery block. Thus ended my very short career with a big gun outfit. Within days I was a new replacement in Co. B, 2nd Battalion, 101st Infantry Regiment, of the 26th (Yankee) Division, an outfit well known in New England, and now a part of General George Patton's Third Army, which was in the process of capturing St. D'Arc, the last stronghold of the fortress city of Metz. I was one of many replacements comprising most of our all extremely unhappy with their new assignment, quickly learning what the M-1 rifle was all about, as well as other aspects of life as an infantryman.


This was in the early weeks of December, and our time was spent mainly in field problems, where the non-coms would walk us through some of the actual skirmishes that had occurred just days earlier. Most of the new arrivals, having come from service units, were familiar with the carbine rille, a smaller and lighter weapon than the M-1 rifle used in the infantry. I, along with infantry trained others, was given the task of teaching the men how to break down and care for their M-1 rifle, close to the best friend they would have in combat.


While many of the new transferred replacements represented the bottom of the barrel, I was able to connect with a few guys with some intelligence, and I developed a respect for two of our non-corns, a Sergeant Lahue who, amazingly, was from Lowell, and a real American Indian who was our corporal. They were both experienced combat soldiers, holding the unit together really, for our Lieutenant and Captain, also transferees from service units, lacking infantry training, did not display much that would inspire our confidence in their leadership. This assessment was confirmed later when our captain went to pieces under the strain of combat and had to be sent to the rear.


It was easy to distinguish the regular experienced combat infantrymen of the 26th Division, as they were really happy and relaxed to find themselves in the rear for a while, not displaying much glee but obviously making the most of getting hot chow and sleeping inside a building, even though it was unheated and there were no bunks.


This rest and re-organization period came to an abrupt halt upon returning from field training on the 19th of December, we were told to pack up our things and assemble outside of the barracks after we had our supper. Personal effects other than what one could carry on his person were put in separate duffel bags, tagged, and turned in for storage, recovered, in my case, over a year later. We were then all loaded into trucks and were soon barreling down the road, snuggling against each other to reduce the cold December air, with our destination unspecified


We rode north for several hours, eventually being dropped off someplace in Luxembourg. In the morning we were assembled and shown a map which outlined the depth of the German penetration through our lines and told how we would be pressing north to engage the enemy which, by that point had gone far west beyond where we would be meeting them. After a hike of some 12 or 14 miles, we dug in and awaited our baptism of fire, which occurred the next day, and all the wondering about what it would be like to be a rifleman in actual combat was soon a thing of the past.

THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE
Historians describe the Battle of the Bulge as the most significant battle of WW II in Europe, essentially turning the tide on the war on the western front. It was also the most costly, with the Allies losing 77,000 men (8,600 killed, 47,000 wounded, 21,000 missing), while the Germans suffered the loss of 82,000 men (13,000 killed, 39,000 wounded, 31,000 missing). Lasting almost exactly 4 weeks, with 159,000 casualties collectively, or 40,000 each week, provides one dimension of the intensity of that particular battle. Staggering when one considers its effect on those who survived the loss of their buddies, to say nothing of the ever-widening circle of grievous loss suffered by families and friends in the states.
                                        
To back up a bit for the benefit of those for whom WWII is not a memory but, truly, ancient history, it is necessary to recall that D-Day, June 6th, occurred six months before the Battle of the Bulge. This beginning was brought home for the youngest among us through the recent motion picture, Saving Private Ryan, which made the invasion and the gore of war particularly vivid.


Going on from there, it took the Allies about a month and a half to break through the German defense of Normandy, this at St. Lo. Once freed up, the Allies moved rapidly through France, particularly the 3rd Army under General Patton, chasing the retreating Germans back to, essentially, defending their own borders at what has been termed the "Western Wall," where their resistance stiffened considerably, bolstered by man-made and natural obstacles, but mainly through the understandable German desire to protect their homeland at all costs. Contributing to what might be called a stalemate, though a lot of fighting was still taking place, was the need for the Allied Forces to hold up until their supply lines could support a major thrust into Germany itself. We had essentially outrun our supply capability due to the welcomed, though unexpected, rapid dash across France. There was a severe need of replenishing our troop losses, as well as assembling the tremendous amount of gasoline, ammunition, food, and other supplies critical to the next big push through to and over the Rhine, and into the heart of Germany.


In their optimism over the routing of the German forces from France, our leaders felt that Germany was in no position to launch a major offensive, busily focusing, rather, on preparing for a massive defense of their homeland, thus we concentrated the strength of our armies on those areas providing the stoutest opposition. The Ardennes Forest, spreading over Luxembourg and part of Belgium, with its sparse roadwork of narrow roads, was seen as the area of least risk, thus our troops were spread particularly thin along the line facing the German border, with a prevailing air of R and R before the coming big push scheduled for mid-December, that to be headed by George Patton's Third Army. He was no doubt chafing at the bit over the coming opportunity to once again display his considerable war skills.
                                        
It was during this period that I tasted combat in the artillery, then was transferred to the infantry, becoming one of Patton's replacements in Metz where, as one historian put it, the Third Army really got its nose bloodied.
To talk about Hitler for a moment....he has been amply described as the fanatical race-mongering dictator that he was...so much so that he is almost an unreal, or mythical, figure in the public mind. One could easily overlook his brilliance and the fire in his bosom that he still had for his beloved fatherland. After a serious attempt on his life by a group of junior officers in August, he spent many weeks in bed recovering from the wounds received from the bomb that had been placed almost at his feet. Historians record a marked growing paranoia in his personality at this time, causing him to assume even greater personal control of every action of the military, and a growing reliance upon his intuitive judgment, forsaking any words of caution by his senior generals.


This is when he conceived what was to be his final masterstroke, when he would split the Allies asunder and regain the war initiative, as well as providing time for the further development of his significant new weapons -- jet-propelled aircraft, rocket weapons, etc. -- by which he expected to annihilate the enemy forces, bringing our politicians to their knees.


This masterstroke was, of course, what came to be called the Battle of the Bulge.
Hitler's strategy was to spend the fall months in assembling a massive force of men and weapons, under the strictest secrecy, attacking the Allies through the most unlikely terrain, the Ardennes Forest, at a time when the weather conditions would not permit significant action by our air forces, relying on surprise and superior mobile forces to penetrate the American and British forces right through Luxembourg and Belgium to the sea at the great port of Antwerp, vital to our supply requirements. This would completely divide the Allied forces between the north and south, providing the opportunity for vast military gains in the chaos he would generate. This would require the amassing of every bit of manpower, tanks, artillery, and other war requirements, accomplished in the knowledge that the very survival of Germany would depend on the outcome of this final offensive. This, undoubtedly, contributed to the determination and ferocity of the average German soldier....the welfare of their country, their families, and their future was dependent on this one grand effort to turn the war around.


Thus, in the early hours of December 16th, the mighty German military machine was, once again, on the march....and their grand plan succeeded as intended, catching us sound asleep, creating tremendous panic and chaos, and actually, within days, penetrating an unbelievable 70 miles within our lines, heading as rapidly as possible for the complete severance of our northern and southern armies through reaching the sea at Antwerp. If successful in completing his march to the sea, Hitler anticipated a mass rout of the British forces, compelling their return to England, a falling out of the uniform allied front and, also, he expected to have sufficient time to complete the development of new rocket fired weapons and jet aircraft, weapons which he promised would bring a rapid vanquishing of Germany's enemies.


Hopefully, this brief historical review will suffice to provide a general understanding of the dire situation created, one which presented the most serious challenge imaginable to our possibility for victory in Europe. Skipping over details that would be required were this to be an extensive historical account, it can be said, in summary, that once the initial shock was overcome, our military leaders responded brilliantly, the fighting men heroically, in facing and overcoming this newly inspired and ferocious enemy. General Eisenhower, supported by Generals Montgomery and Bradley, quickly set about redeploying troops to bear down from the north and up from the south in an attempt to slice through the vast finger of the German penetration. The first to swing his divisions from the western wall to the north was, as one might expect, General Patton, earning a special citation in all historical accounts for the skill and speed displayed in swinging his forces north into Luxembourg. Thus, shortly before Christmas 1944, I found myself embarking on my first direct front line experience, this in the rear of a little cemetery in Nothum,  not knowing what to expect as we started down that hill in the eerie and short-lived quiet of that particular morning.


Life as a Combat Rifleman
It is likely that, just as in all endeavors, one's experiences and their consequences upon the body and mind of the individual affected may differ considerably from others in similar circumstances. Despite that fact, my experiences and the effect they had upon me probably are not very distant from those who were in the same spot and time as I.


The overarching concern for all of us was that we now found ourselves naked, in the sense that there was nothing between us and those who would kill us, sometimes being close enough to hear shouted commands or whatever between the Germans. This put us on the receiving end of whatever was thrown at us....rifle and machine-gun fire, mortars, powerful artillery, tanks, and the dreaded Schü-mine, a vicious booby trap which would only blow off only your foot if you were lucky. Such kind of close-up action never seemed to be one-sided, rather a constant pounding exchange of terror between the facing forces.


It's not shameful to admit that fear of being hurt or killed was a constant worry under such conditions, and I was not spared those concerns. One author has stated that "Physical courage is little more than the ability to control the physical fear which all normal men have, and cowardice does not consist in being afraid but in giving away to that fear." Granting that, one might ask how the individual manages to overcome and control this understandable fear? It lies somewhere in one's desire to retain the good opinion of one's fellow with pride helping to smother fear somewhat. Another compelling factor is that each Gl knew that he was as dependent upon the performance of the other guy as he (the other guy) was dependent upon you. Sociologists might classify it as a "social exchange." Whatever..... We needed each other and you got your share of another's caring by displaying the same interest in his welfare. Though we were strangers to each other just days before, certain alliances were formed quickly, particularly as we would buddy up, two men to a foxhole, sharing the whole extreme business together. Mutual misery can bring about much that is good as well as that which is less admirable with some individuals. Certain guys, some truly slobs, were to be avoided, while, as happened to me at one memorable moment, another man might save your life, as I shall describe at another point.
  

  

Digging in. This depicts it all. Setting in the for the night in the snow-filled woods. Dead soldier probably picked off by a German Sniper.

The other constant remembered most vividly, and a concomitant threat to all in Luxembourg at that time was the weather… fearful, unremitting cold, heavy snows, and an all-around miserable physical environment. One soon experienced numbness in all extremities, it becoming an abiding condition of daily existence. Those particular days have been described as the worst winter weather experienced in central Europe in the entire century, which will get no argument from me. It bears mentioning that a combat rifleman spends, with rare exception, all 24 hours outside, most of it in a miserable foxhole dug by him and his foxhole buddy, often snuggling together to retain whatever warmth might be available, often going days on end in that situation. This is what ultimately ended my combat experience, as my family is well aware, putting me in the hospital for close to five months as a result of severe trench foot. More about this later.


Much of my life at that time seems a bit of a jumble, in that I have difficulty in reconstructing subsequent days with precision. Certain events remain, however, some extremely vivid, and they will have to serve as a few examples of the elements comprising my brief but intense life as a combat rifleman. These, recounted in no particular order, some of lesser or greater importance, but not without interest, are what follows. That they are my most vivid memories accounts for their egregious aspects.


It is not surprising that one's baptism in fire remains as a clear memory. In my case, our unit was assembled facing a hillside cemetery outside of Nothum (the town being identified on my subsequent visit with Allan in the 1970s), and we were told that we could expect to find the enemy someplace close by. We spread out in proper infantry fashion, going past the cemetery and continuing down the barren hill on the further side. There was a road at the base of the hill, with heavy woods coming to the edge of the road on the other side. All was quiet, with the bulk of our company working its way down the hillside when all hell broke out from the woods beyond. Wisely, the Germans had held their fire until most of us were exposed. In my case, I ran as fast and, to reduce my vulnerability, as erratically as I could toward the gully alongside the road at the bottom, and gained some protection as I snuggled up against the few feet of protection available.


What followed was quite tragic as many of the men, being untrained as infantrymen, immediately hit the ground upon hearing gunfire instead of running for the protection of the gully below. Upon realizing their mistake, they would get up and try to join the rest of us at the bottom but got mowed down by concentrated German fire. One recent transferee that I had gotten to know was a fellow from Belmont, married with one child. I was sickened to see him killed, having been one of the ones who made the wrong call.


This became a tough situation, with us remaining pinned down along the gully for a few days. Our immediate concern was our left flank, where the woods crossed over to our side of the road, raising the fear of their coming at us from that direction. There were a lot of shouts for our machine-gunner to set up in those woods on our right, which was soon done, with their firing over our heads into the woods beyond.


We all got busy digging in where we had jumped, which wasn't easy as we couldn't stand up to do any shoveling. The first night was a horror, with wounded strung out along the gully, able to receive assistance from the company aid-men (real heroes), but unable to be brought back to an aid station. The man on my right had a bad leg wound. He and others were dragged along in the gully into the woods on our left and then brought up over the wooded hill to be evacuated. While down along this roadside gully for a few days, this same route was used to relieve us a few at a time to get some sleep and heat up some rations in a farmhouse nearby, then returning to let others do the same.


As neither side was presenting much of a target at this time, the firing consisted of our
Machine gunner and theirs firing sporadically across over our heads. At one point they got
firing back and forth with the familiar "Shave and a haircut," rhythmic firing coming from our side, to be answered by the expected "Two bits!" from the German gunners. Even in war, there can be play sometimes.


Eventually, we were all directed to leave via the established gully path, to assemble and be moved forward at a different point, close to a nearby crossroads. I’ll discuss the events that occurred there at another point.


To continue with these random memories:


One day a few of us were charged with bringing back a group of 40 or 50 captured Germans to the battalion collection point for POW’s. They were docile enough, in the same tough shape as we were, but it was a bit hazardous as there was always the possibility of being picked off by a German sniper, essentially suicide soldiers with special rifle sights who would stay hidden, most often high in a tree, an area where the regular German forces had been routed. The sniper's job was to wreak whatever havoc he could before being picked off himself.


We, therefore, had reason to keep prodding the group to keep moving rapidly. One of our men got impatient, or worried enough, that he started firing at the ranks of the prisoners, hitting one in the buttocks. Though we gave him hell for carelessness, nothing more was done, no reporting the incident, etc. By this point, I guess we had all become sufficiently weary and desensitized by what we were that his behavior didn't produce the kind of outrage and formal response that it would have in a different setting.


Incidentally, as we were reaching the battalion collection point we were filmed by one of the cameramen covering the war. I’ve always hoped that someday I would see a few seconds of that event in subsequent documentaries or photography collections. No luck.

I got a real unexpected bonus that day, however, as it became dark before we could return to our unit, so we joined some tankers who were holed up in a barn, enabling us to get a super night's rest without interruption. In reality, we were not very far behind the front line, much firing was still occurring, but the knowledge that someone else was between you and the Germans gave us welcome relief. It was all a matter of proximity.
On another night I found myself with a small group allowed a night’s sleeping break in the cellar of a farmhouse. I missed out on getting a spot on the sugar beet, possibly large
turnip, storage pile, settling for a skinny board, probably 12 or 15 inches wide, between me and the floor. I don't recall how, but we came into possession of a few more blankets than usual, giving me the luxury of sleeping under two blankets. Other men arrived as time went on and at some point during the night I woke up shivering, with one blanket less. Don't know where it went, but someone was more comfortable than he would have been otherwise.


Later, studying Shakespeare's King Lear in college I read something about how deprivation can make even a humble comfort seem like much more, putting me in mind of how glad I was to find that skinny board. Tolstoy also made a reference in Anna Karenina:


There are no conditions to which a man cannot get accustomed, especially if he sees that everyone around him lives in the same way. Levin would not have believed it possible three months earlier that he could go quietly to sleep in the circumstances he now found himself.


My closest call to becoming a casualty from enemy fire occurred one day when we were sitting up in our foxholes, with no particular combat activity going on in our vicinity. We heard the noise made when nearby German mortar shells were dropped into their firing tubes, this producing the immediate response of ducking down into foxhole before the shells made their arc and landed in our area. Simultaneously, there was quite a lot of rifle and machine-gun fire thrown our way. My arms holding my rifle went up as I threw myself down on my back, and a bullet grazed my right arm, not doing any serious harm. Had we not responded to the first sounds of mortars going off, however, my body would have been where my arms were a second later. My luck held out that day.


I was sent back to get the scrape on my arm cleaned up and bandaged at the battalion aid station, located in a farmhouse just to our rear, leaving our own medic to take care of more urgent problems occurring on the line. Several wounded men were seated or stretched out on the ground in front of the house, probably having already been given some morphine to hold the pain. There were some very sad cases spread around the ground but the one that got to me was a GI sitting on a bench, holding up his injured hand, as if for his inspection. It was quite shredded, causing parts of it to hang down, making an extended extremity. He was crying, more in shock at what he was seeing than from pain, I believe. Maybe the thoughts of what such a wound would do to my amateur piano playing was at the bottom of it, but his condition bothered me more than some of the more seriously wounded. The grazing on my arm was so slight that its scar is barely discernible today, but it's one souvenir of the war that will always stay with me.


In war, there are always some deaths that occur accidentally, sometimes needlessly, and I observed a few of these events. In one case, our Captain, who was disliked by most of us, directed our Corporal, an American Indian, and a very good and experienced soldier,
to scout out the area in front of us. The corporal objected as he was quite certain that there was a sniper in the forward woods. The Captain ordered him forward, anyway,....he went, and he was killed by the sniper. Sometime later we advanced, passing his body, his helmet on his upright grounded rifle. Only rigid Army protocol protected the Captain from the resentment and anger we all felt.


It’s worth noting that this Captain went entirely to pieces within a few days, having to be evacuated as a psycho case, which made none of us sorry. I didn’t witness his disintegration, though I did in the case of a sergeant, who had been with the division right from the states and was a mighty tough guy in our estimation, became completely incapacitated, crying and refusing to get up out of his foxhole. Psychologists have written that all men are subject to being broken depending on their makeup and the experiences they have endured, which I truly believe and have witnessed. The infantry condition, with no policy of planned replacement of combat personnel, created a situation in which men came to believe that, eventually, they would either die or receive a serious injury, for that was the example they were witnessing as, in time, those around them were being steadily lost one way or another. Even the strongest came to live with a certain numbness, when such thoughts were pushed out of one’s mind until the usual return of serious fear would grab hold once again.


I witnessed another sad situation one day when we found ourselves in a fairly open area,
being preceded up the hill behind a line of tanks. Many GI's were right behind the tanks as they made their slow progress toward the brow of the hill, while I was part of a group being kept back in reserve. Suddenly, the tanks and infantrymen were subjected to heavy incoming artillery, knocking down a lot of men. The tankers immediately hit the gas backing up, getting out of there as fast as possible. We witnessed the tanks running over some of the wounded GI's, counting at least seven men who were, for a certainty killed that way....probably unavoidably as the tankers must have been following hasty, possibly correct, orders by their leader.


One of the weirdest sights I saw occurred one night when I was sitting in a foxhole, putting in my two hours of duty along a forest edge overlooking an open area. I was passing time by saying the rosary when suddenly some kind of projectile, not unlike a fourth of July rocket, came shooting across the distant sky parallel to the horizon. I might have concluded that it was a meteor except that suddenly it changed directions, aiming up into the heavens, where it finally disappeared from sight. A decade later, I might have called it a UFO, but the only conclusion I could make then was that it was one of the German's rocket-propelled weapons gone haywire. They were shooting rocket-propelled V-bombs to London at that time, but I wouldn't expect that Luxembourg would have been on the flight path. This will remain a mystery.


Another scene that has stuck in my mind occurred when, for some reason that I can't recall, we had reason to retrench our earlier steps, passing through a village that we had taken earlier in the day. The artillery and tankers had done quite a job in leveling most of the buildings which, in the dark of night, were still smoldering, some burning, with flames casting eerie shadows. Some poor cows were stumbling through the single village street, bellowing loudly in their need for milking and feeding. There were also several extremely bloated remains of other cows and horses that had been caught in the crossfire. Strangely enough, the harsh sounds of war seemed to be taking a break, creating a surprising quietness overall, with no small arms or shelling going on, just the crackling of the fires and the painful cries of the animals. Worst of all, however, was an overwhelming nauseous stench emanating from the destroyed village, a smell of charred remains of every sort, material and animal, which I can smell again at this moment. A smell of death, in a way, defining the desolate scene before us, a tribute to the futility of it all.


My only face to face hand to hand experience with the enemy in an area just beyond a major crossroads which our company had gained on the day, a significant accomplishment as one of the roads went to Bastogne, nine or ten miles away, which was surrounded and under heavy enemy pressure at that time. We got pinned down in the woods on the further side of the road, digging our foxholes as quickly as we could chip away at the frozen soil. Being unable to move around very much, I wound up with a different foxhole mate than Charlie Malasepena, my usual buddy from Brooklyn, with critical consequences occurring a few hours later.


After dark, I, along with two other guys, was dispatched to return to the building directly on the crossroads to recover some German sleeping bags, noticed earlier, which we coveted as further protection from the freezing weather. There were several bicycles in the yard and building, abandoned by the hastily departing Germans. We then encountered a severely wounded German soldier who was helpless groaning out something in German. We were of little use to him as the darkness precluded our passing him to the rear for treatment by our medics. It might have been a service to put him out of his misery but, for all we knew, his injuries may not have been life-threatening. He was disarmed, apparently by some of our people earlier in the day. If he survived he, presumably, would have been discovered by those behind us on the following day, given medical treatment and, most likely, have wound up eventually as a stateside POW, warm and comfortable, maybe helping to bring in some crop out west. We left him to whatever his fate was to be.


We were able to round up quite a few sleeping bags and, stealthily returning to our bivouac area, distributed them to our best friends, saving one for my new foxhole mate.


The usual pattern when holed up as we were, was for each man to take a two-hour stint of watchfulness while the other man slept. Just before dawn, I woke up, sitting up to take an  assessment of the situation. Instead of finding my "buddy" taking his turn at staying awake, I saw that he was sound asleep, completely zipped up in his German sleeping bag.. I sat there debating whether to wake him up or let him sleep, as it was almost time for my turn at watching. At that point I sensed or heard some activity in the snow-laden forest in front of me, immediately seeing some vague forms moving through the snow-laden trees toward me in the dim early light. Upon my hasty shout of "Halt," they continued to emerge toward me (I have never figured out why they didn't stop at my command). I fired and brought down the first German, while the second German, apparently concluding that I would fire on him next, ran forward and grabbed the end of my rifle, and we proceeded in a kind of tug of war for possession of the rifle. This development was made possible because I had not had time to check my rifle upon waking up, a routine task, and upon firing the first round my rifle jammed but good. This occurred because the accumulated snow had not been cleared from the track necessary for the automatic ejection of the first bullet and the advance of another one into the firing slot, with this snow being compressed into ice, putting the weapon out of action for the moment.


I was, of course, still within my sleeping bag from the waist down, wrestling for my rifle while my foxhole buddy was shouting and flubbing around trying to unzip his bag. As might be expected, I too was shouting for assistance which, fortunately, came from my true “buddy,” Charlie, firing over our heads from his nearby foxhole. The other German immediately raised his hands in surrender and was taken prisoner. All of this occurred in far less time than is taken in this recounting. The fact that they had previously discarded their weapons made their intent known. but that was not evident to me as they came at me through the murky light of early dawn.


The wounded German was, along with his surrendering fellow soldier, sent back to our battalion area for treatment and processing. I hope they both survived and wonder how they might be describing this event today, an incident we shared in a snow-filled forest on that early Luxembourg dawn. I imagine that, as with me, it represents the most prominent memory of our total experience as combat infantrymen. Whatever happened later, that was their last day as fighting soldiers.


Christmas eve under war conditions must stick in every soldier’s memory, with long thoughts about Christmases at home… warn, happy, going to Midnight Mass. The 24th of December found us in Kotschette, a crossroads town which we, after a few skirmishes, cleared of Germans by late afternoon. Some of us were distributed to dig in, forming a protective line outside of the crossroads, while others, including me, were fortunate to be allowed to spend the night in a small inn called, as I learned upon returning years later, Hotel Weis-Welter.


Two events occurred shortly upon entering the building. Two Germans wearing white camouflage clothing were spied working their way toward us in a nearby field, quickly removed from action by those closest to them outside. After that we started to enjoy our good fortune, opening some of the wine bottles and, in my case, starting to pick out a tune on a piano found in the main room of the inn. Suddenly there was a loud explosion upstairs, where other guys were scouting out the bedrooms. It turned out that one of the men had failed to return the safety pin to his unused rifle grenade (unlike a hand-thrown grenade, this one is fired from the end of a rifle, requiring the removal of the pin before firing, but not activated until fired). Somehow, he had accidentally triggered his rifle. All activity, especially the piano playing, came to a halt as we first thought it might have been a German booby trap… A piano would have presented that possibility. The four men in that upstairs room were brought out and laid on the ground in front of the inn, getting serviced by the medics. As I recall, I believe only two of them lived.


My sleeping spot for the night was on the floor of the main room, and it so happened that I was on guard duty at the front door of the inn when Christmas commenced. Possibly out of mutual respect for the holiday, there was no artillery, mortar, or any kind of fire going on that night. While my guarding stint was uneventful, I've always recalled that Christmas Eve at some point during the many happy ones that have followed.
The events on Christmas Day were described in a Christmas letter that I wrote several years ago, which will be enclosed as an appendix.


One pleasant memory, for a change of pace, was that of a delicious piglet dinner we had one night. We were spending the night in a farmhouse and one of our men, experienced in such things, killed a piglet and then cooked it in a frying pan on the wood-fired stove. How succulent it was!


My days in combat came to a close sometime in mid-January (wish I had been able to keep a journal). At this point, our company membership had, through combat losses, declined so drastically that we were combined with other remnants from other units to make up a reasonable combat group. It developed one evening that, due to my general declining physical condition, I was allowed, along with others in similar to spend the night in a farmhouse well behind our line of combat. Surprisingly, the farmer and his wife were still in the place, and they heated some food, which we ate in front of a roaring open fireplace. After dinner, the farmer started playing a few tunes on an accordion, making for a wonderful respite from the preceding days.


That became, for me, a night of horrible pain. I had taken off my boots to dry my socks in front of the fire, and I went to sleep with my right side close to the hearth. Within a few hours my unshorn feet, particularly my right foot, began to swell up, eventually, the right one looked like it could burst, it was so distorted, and the pain was excruciating. By morning I was incapable of walking… my feet were useless… so large that I could not put my overshoes over them, never mind my combat boots. I, along with another guy with the same problem, trench foot, was placed on a stretcher mounted on a jeep and brought back to the battalion aid station, then going by military ambulance to a tented field hospital, where I spent the night. The pleasure of sleeping on a cot and being cared for by genuine American nurses was offset by the serious condition of some of the men around me. The man closest to me, still under the effect of the anesthesia after having his leg removed, started flirting with the nurse, then burst into a happy song, yet to learn of his loss, his joy turned to sobbing later in the night.


The next day we were brought by ambulance to a general hospital in Paris, en-route to what would become my months of recovery in England. My combat days had come to an end truth be told, that did not make me unhappy. Except for leaving Charlie Malasapena, I had little of loyalty to what remained of my company, glad to leave before my number might be called in a more serious way, which I saw as an inevitable outcome in one way or another in view of what was going on at that time.

BETTER DAYS
My final 18 months as a soldier were, compared to what had taken place during the first 18 months, a time of sheer enjoyment, a somewhat rich European experience, tarnished only by occasional bouts of homesickness, quickly offset in knowing that my return was now predictable.


Four months as a patient. I had a pleasant surprise upon my first night in the large American General Hospital in Paris. In its thorough approach to accounting for all casualties, the Army had clerks checking our dog tags at each new medical facility, duly recording the details. A clerk performing that duty was slowly proceeding from one cot to the next and, as he got closer, I recognized him to be David Lane, a neighbor in our Highlands section of Lowell, and one of my high school classmates. When he asked me my name, I responded with “Bernard Huntley of Lowell, Mass," which produced a puzzled look on his face as he tried to connect me with his Lowell days. At this point I had not had a haircut for over two months and, no doubt had lost some weight off my normal skinny frame.... a bit of a sight. We had a great exchange about Lowell and discussed our individual military experiences. Later he returned with a couple of candy bars and some paperback books, which were called pocketbooks in those days. My parents were able to get a direct report on my condition through his subsequent letter writing to his father, a fireman who was a regular customer in our hardware store, which must have relieved them a bit.


On that subject, my parents had received a telegram from the Dept. of Army saying that I had been slightly wounded in action, with details to follow, which is now in my possession. I got a note off to them as soon as I could, suggesting they hold writing to me until I got my new hospital address.


From Paris we went by hospital train, emblazoned with large red crosses on the roof to protect it from enemy strafing, to a French port, probably Cherbourg or Le Havre on the English Channel. The railroad cars on a hospital train consist of a double line of racks the length of the car, upon which our cots could be stacked, four of five high as I recall. This crossing of the Channel was very different from the one of the previous October in that the ship was all white, like a cruise ship, prominently illuminated at night to display the large red crosses painted on the sides. Bright, cheery, ultra-clean, warm, and with hot meals....plus pretty American nurses. A delight, lifting our spirits considerably.


Our next stop was the 7th General Hospital, outside of St. Albans, about twenty miles from London, going again by hospital train from the port. The 7th General was comprised of a number of Quonset huts, ward-sized rounded metal buildings, shaped as if made by cutting a large metal pipe in half, each elongated section resting flat on the ground. These were heated by two G.I. issue pot-bellied stoves, which could really sometimes glow red on the sides. Each building was a typical ward, with hospital beds lining each side and a toilet and two small rooms at one end. All huts were joined by open wooden roofed walkways, spreading over what must have been open countryside before the war. The ward was what you might expect, with hospital beds lined up on each side. 








  



What distinguished outward, and several others, was that the beds were made as if they were going to be slept in from either end, this to permit our ugly damaged feet to extend in the air from the bottom. Any contact with bed clothing was quite painful. We must have been a site, displaying our feet as if they were trophies… I guess they were combat trophies in a way.
I soon discovered that most of the hospital staff was made up of doctors, nurses, and aides from the Boston City Hospital, having enlisted as a group to assist in the war effort. Even the priest had been their hospital chaplain. Even better, the prettiest nurse of the lot was one of the two assigned to our ward, the other being a rather plain Jane of Polish extraction, who really bossed us around. Initially, we were all ga-ga over the cute one, but we soon learned that her heart wasn't devoted to our care, where the other nurse was a gem in that respect. She was the one who started right in washing up her grimy bed-ridden patients, hair shampoos and all. Speaking of hair. I had so much of it at this point that the guy in the next bed, a hillbilly from the South, called me "Railhead," a nickname that stuck with me for the next several months.


It seemed that not much could be done to accelerate the healing process of trench foot, the main concern being gangrene. Several men lost feet, usually only one, and many up and down the ward lost toes. The toes on my right foot were of particular concern to the doctor, with the large toe as black as tar. At one point they had improvised an iron lung, a device which surrounded one's body, with just the head and feet projecting, designed to produce powerful internal pressure which compelled the patient to breathe deeply as the machine went through its machinations. The idea, apparently, was to stimulate the blood flow to your legs and feet. Not painful, and probably not very helpful, but I'd give them an "A" for effort.


I was to remain at the 7th General Hospital until the following May, bed-ridden at first, gradually healing as the months progressed. Many in the ward, having lost limbs, were shipped home for discharge, the rest of us passing much of the time by reading, playing cards, Monopoly, and checkers, having bull-sessions, etc., eating our meals in bed. It is of interest to note that, while we were keenly following the progress of the war, there never were any discussions of our combat experiences, but much talk about home and families and our plans for the future. BBC and AFN programs were piped into the wards, which is how I became familiar with the wonderful Welsh male choirs that were broadcast on Sunday mornings.


My ugly right foot gradually grew new skin under the black parts and, one fine day, the whole blackness sloughed off my toes completely, revealing bright new pink toes underneath. Not long thereafter I was able to become ambulatory… A blessing to do away with the bedpans… and soon I was recovered enough to go to the Mess Hall for my meals. By this time I was receiving mail and, sometimes, packages from home. Soon I was doing well enough to get passes for a day in London, later getting a full week's leave in London before being shipped back to France.


The poets have written rapturously on the loveliness of springtime in England, and the spring of 1945 was especially beautiful, possibly to make up for the horribly cold preceding winter. Our hospital was a couple of miles outside of St.Albans proper, with our route to the train station taking us through fields and small woods. The wildflowers were profuse, the bees having a holiday, the sun bringing rich fragrance from all that was growing around us… really special. I remember that spring very well, indeed, particularly the walk to and from St.Albans. As the feller' says, "Ain't it good to be alive?"


Another benefit to finally getting on my feet was that I was able to take advantage of some of the field trips that were arranged by the Red Cross personnel. These included a visit to England's movie-making center, where we stood behind the cameras, watching Celia Parker and some other star filming a scene in which I got to see in its entirety a few years later. Another day we toured Cambridge University, given tea by one of the dons in the very quarters occupied by Erasmus, centuries before. A Sunday afternoon's trip was to a large theater in London where we were given a marvelous show by the stars of the British musical stage.


Our local English pub experience centered around a small pub just outside our hospital area. This was a most friendly place, with the locals often insisting on buying "a pint for the Yanks.” The resident pianist was missing some fingers, but that didn't deter the crowd from joining in lustily on I’ve Got a Sixpence, and all ten verses of the naughty Roll Me Over in the Clover. These visits gave us a good impression of average, working-class English folks, freely extending their hospitality and friendship to us.


Another example of this (with an ulterior motive, however) was when another GI and I were given a written invitation to dinner in an English home, this being delivered by the two young lads who visited our wards regularly, sometimes bringing flowers, singing for us, and always providing a bright note of cheer to the patients. The invitation came from a very modest family, mother and two children, with Daddy away in the war, living in one of the many narrow row houses that are typical of English cities, with dinner served on their very best crockery, the entree concealed under a covered platter. After a non-alcoholic toast, the cover was lifted with a flourish, revealing a fine looking square of Spam (which I could no longer stomach!). They must have used a lot of their meat ration for the dinner and we responded as if it were the rarest of roasts.


The ulterior motive behind all this became apparent when we were introduced to
the eighteen-year-old daughter… obese, dyed blonde hair, and giggling constantly. Mother encouraged us to accompany her to see their small vegetable garden. "You young folks go enjoy yourself." There were hints about how much fun the picture shows are, etc, but neither of us rose to the bait. Still, it was a nice thing they did for us.


One of the things the hospital did was to provide transportation to a large roller skating rink, encouraging our participation as they thought it would help blood circulation in our limbs. I was amazed to see that live music was provided by four real old musicians, ensconced on a small balcony high above the floor. There were a lot of unattached English girls skating and, once I got the hang of it, I started giving a lot of attention to a very pretty (and slim!) English girl who was extremely shy around GI's. When I skated with her a week later I got up the courage to ask her out to see a movie. She said her mother would not approve but, after a bit more skating, she agreed to meet me at the movie theater the following weekend… minus mother's blessings. It was a nice time but she was so nervous that she wouldn't even hold my hand in the dark. I wasn't even allowed to walk her home. Oh, well, she blew her chance to become a GI war bride!


At one point toward the end of my hospital stay, I drew K.P. duty, reporting to the Mess Sergeant very early in the morning. Somehow we discovered that we were both from Lowell (maybe my New England accent was noticed), which turned out to be a most fortunate thing as, instead of having to put in an unpleasant day of kitchen duty, he brought me across to his quarters, where I spent a most pleasant day reading his magazines, curled up cozily by the warm fire. After the war this fellow, who was of Greek extraction, returned to his post as some sort of junior executive for Necco Candies in Cambridge, and I ran into him almost every day when I was commuting by train to Boston University.


As the month of May approached, it was determined that I needed no further medical treatment, though I was placed in limited service, which meant that I would not be returned to frontline combat service. As was the standard practice, I was given a leave, which I spent taking in the many sights of London. The Tower (the Royal jewels were not on display due to the war), St.Paul's, and Buckingham Palace. German V-Bombs (rocket-propelled) were still arriving in London but, as interception wasn't possible and their targets were random (one landed near our hospital), the British didn't sound the sirens nor bother with using the air raid shelters. These were pretty powerful weapons, however, being easily heard upon landing at a distance. Onesuchcamein while I was listening to a tour talk by one of the Beefeaters at the Tower, causing him to hesitate a moment as if to re-assure himself that it wasn't close by, then proceeding as if nothing had happened. London, of course, still displayed terrible scars from the Blitz of months before, with hundreds of homeless people spending their nights on palettes deep down on the subway platforms. Passengers walked by these sleeping hordes just as if they were the most normal of sights. The British are a gritty bunch, alright.


Along with other GI's, I lodged at the Red Cross dormitory close by Speaker's Comer at Columbia Arch. These soapbox orators really drew the crowds on Sunday mornings, and I got a kick out of them. Most speeches were on politics and the war. One man, however, led a small crowd in singing various songs of the day, Bluebirds Over the White Cliffs of Dover, I'll Be Seeing You, We'll Meet, etc. I was told that he was a successful businessman who did that every Sunday morning as his contribution to the war effort.


Entertainment recalled includes the stage-play Arsenic and Old Lace, in which the British actors interpretation of a wise-guy New York newspaper reporter was really corny, and seeing Judy Garland in Meet Me In St. Louis, in a handsome mammoth West End movie palace. This one still had its powerful pipe organ, with the spotlighted organist and his all-white console rising dramatically out of the orchestra floor to provide a few numbers before the show started, a practice once common to American movie houses.


The center of American GI's in London was at the Rainbow Club in Piccadilly Circus, which was also the hub for buses to the various Red Cross dormitory facilities spread around London. One of the fellows I met at my dormitory invited me on a double date that he had set up with two British nurses. Movies, a bite to eat (I became very fond of English pork pies, often eaten cold), and walking them back to their dormitory. A bit of friendly necking, then returning for transportation to Piccadilly Circus late in the evening. A most vivid memory, however, was that when we got to Piccadilly Circus the newsboys were shouting “Extra...extra...President Roosevelt Dead!” What a shock! Not only had he been our great wartime leader, he had been my president since the time when I was seven years of age. The effect was every bit as stunning as the death of President Kennedy, years later, and I imagine that any person of my age can recall exactly what they were doing when they heard the news.


Following my fine week in London, I returned to the hospital from where, very shortly, I departed to report to an Army base for processing and, within days, I was once again crossing the Channel, this time to a replacement depot in Le Havre. awaiting the Army's desire for my next assignment.


  



My stay in Le Havre, though brief, was memorable in that V-E (Victory in Europe) Day occurred on the same day that we shipped out, on 40 & 8 boxcars once again, en-route to southern France. All of the men, I believe, were hospital dischargees returning to duty and, as we were marched down the back streets to the railhead, there was one heck of a celebration on the main street where the locally stationed GI's were marching to the cheers, hugs, and kisses of the delirious Frenchmen and women. Most ofthese were black soldiers assigned to Quartermaster duty, which produced a lot of grousing from our group… typical of the infantry, we thought… we did all the heavy lifting and they get all the glory. Infantrymen like to gripe but, being at the bottom of the barrel when it came to duty, they often had quite a bit worthy of their gripes.


The train trip took well over a week to reach Marseille where we were dispersed to various assignments. As the war in the Pacific was still going on, the Army quickly set up three large staging areas, made up of endless rows of 16 man tents, these to accommodate the large number of troops that were to be re-deployed from Marseille, through the Suez Canal finally being assembled at some island or other place to bring their force against the stubborn Japanese.


I took Typing I for a semester in High School and no single course has served me better. In this case it resulted in my assignment as a clerk-typist to the Troop Movement office in Calas Staging Area, the largest ofthe three areas feeding the port, holding as many as 70,000 men, some with enough service points to be heading home, but most with still more combat experience to come. Our office was responsible for establishing the troops, usually a whole division at once, in their designated areas and then facilitating their subsequent boarding ship in Marseille. Most of my work consisted of typing up troop movement orders and answering the telephone. Tony Germano,who was to become a close friend, was assigned as a filing clerk. Two German P.O.W.'s were also assigned to our office, one as a general assistant, the other as the operator of our mimeograph machine. The general assistant was a very dour German who devoted every free moment to the studying of English, while the other was a young man our own age, friendly, accommodating in every way, and very conscientious about doing his job.
Many other P.O.W.'s worked around the post, most of them unguarded until they returned to their barricaded area at night. They knew good duty when they saw it and didn't cause any trouble.


As long as we did our job reliably this was an easy assignment for all of us as well. Our tents were warmed with the usual GI stoves (southern France got cold in the winter months which followed) and, in that our officers were also ex-combat soldiers who knew what most of us had come through, there was almost a complete absence of typical Army "chicken- ____," Other than the Army's monthly check for VD by the medical personnel (when we all had to assemble naked under our raincoats and helmet liners), we seldom had any parade or company inspections. It was here that I became close friends with Tony Germano, visiting him later in Chicago, Howard Samp, Bill Martin, Thomas Wammes, Charlie Monson, a Mormon, and Bill Shaw, who were enjoyable tent mates. Bill Shaw was by far the brightest, enjoying long discussions on most any subject that interested him, while Bill Martin, who became my roommate on our subsequent  assigmnent to Aix-en-Provence, was more than a little bright. Though Bill Martin, Charlie Monson and Bill Shaw already had some college experience, I found that I didn't lag too far behind when we got in our bull sessions, this experience helping to take out the mystique I associated with college training, encouraging me to formulate more ambitious educational plans than I had upon entering the service. Seeing that they didn't seem too much smarter than I was a learning experience in itself.
To Recount a few random memories of this period:
The Army provided transportation to and from Marseille, this on large open semi-trailers lined with benches, and the troops queued up every day for a few hours in Marseille, respite from the days when hell would re-commence in a few weeks. We got to know Marseille, an ancient city of over a million, quite well with our visits in town centering around Rue de Cannibierre, Marseille's main thoroughfare which ran right down to the old port, which was the center for the extensive black marketing activities, France having become a cigarette and chocolate bar economy. Some fifty-four years later Rita and I got to spend several days in a hotel overlooking this very spot, with the famouse Pont de Lourdes church atop a steep hill across the bay. There was a large Red Cross club at the further end of the street, across from a large church, and the Army had taken over two movie theaters along the Rue de Cannibierre. Outside of each there were small stalls selling two kinds of sandwiches, one of some small fish (which I never tried), the other a sandwich of fresh tomatoes and sweet onions between great crusty bread, these wrapped in newspaper sheets. It resulted in a theater full of GI's munching while they watched an American movie.


Another treat was the delicious large black heart cherries that were sold in the marketplace, which were as delicious as could be desired, causing me to eat to the point of being uncomfortable.


The Army maintained an outdoor kitchen and mess at our semi-trailer drop-off/pick-up point, not far from the Rue de Cannebierre. After eating we would go through a line to dump our garbage and wash our mess kits in boiling water. French women and children would cluster at the beginning of the line, encouraging us to dump our unfinished food into the GI gallon fruit cans they held on improvised string handles. This meant everything went in together....beet juice, bread crusts, meat gristle, fruit cocktail juice, etc. Pretty unsavory, but a blessing to those with nothing.


With cigarettes, bought in the PX for $1.20 a carton, bringing $20 on the black market, and a five cent Hershey bar bringing a dollar or two, most all GI's took to selling some of their purchases to augment their meager salaries. It was at this time that I took up smoking cigars, which were not rationed, in order to sell my cigarettes. I remember well puffing my first cigar riding on a semi into Marseille, becoming sick as a dog. For some reason, the image of this skinny kid smoking a big stogie always brought hilarious laughter from Rita and kids when I would recount the tale in later years. I don't think I looked that funny.


As mentioned previously, as long as we performed our duties responsibly we were left pretty much alone, freed ofthe usual Army folderol. This atmosphere didn't extend to reporting late for work, however, which Tony Germano and I had done a few times due to his being a very slow starter in the morning. This led to a really funny event in that our new captain, not nearly as easy-going as the previous major, angrily sent us back to our tent area with the threat of a courtmartial, a ridiculous possibility. Our own company commander, who was responsible for deciding our fate, chuckled when telling us how very angry the captain was when he telephoned to press his charge, it being obvious that he, too, was not very fond of our office head. He said something like, “How’d you boys like a little company punishment? The next two days are to be spent shoveling on the company coal pile,” an assignment which was pretty funny in that all we could do was to shovel the coal into a new pile and then shovel it back to where it was before… all done with anything but haste in the hot sun. We took a lot of razzing from our buddies going past the coal piles, giving us a few laughs as well. Even got a wry smile from our company commander when he greeted us with, “How you guys doin'?”


It was at this time that I had the opportunity to expand my cultural horizons, despite being a lowly Gl living in a tent on a windswept plain. Some of my friends, having come from more privileged backgrounds, were quite familiar with classical music, and I was soon accompanying them to attend operas and symphony concerts in Marseille, a new experience that I found enjoyable. My musical interest being thus revived after being dormant since joining the Army, I took the further step of enrolling in a special program wherein the Army paid for private piano lessons with a fine French teacher, Madame Chouchard, whose husband was a member of the Marseille Symphony Orchestra. This was, apparently, part of a program to aid the local community, which was still suffering from severe shortages of every sort.


Though I had weekly lessons, my progress was somewhat limited in that the only piano on base required close to an hour's walk each way for practice purposes. Despite this limitation on my progress. Madame Chouchard was very happy to have me as a pupil as, in addition to providing some income, I usually brought some staples from our Army mess, small amounts of sugar, coffee, or marmalade. Though they were finding their way out of a difficult period, they lived in a very nice apartment, reflecting a cultured atmosphere, and my lessons soon expanded into social visits as well.


In this way I learned that the Germans were not above corruption when they were occupying the city. The Chouchard's son, in his twenties, was involved in distributing an underground newspaper, a very serious offense which led to his arrest by the Gestapo, subsequent “trial”, and sentence to death. Drawing upon the financial resources of the family, the Chouchards were able to bribe certain German officials gaining, ultimately, the quiet release of their son. Another example that, despite ideology, hard cash can sometimes influence the course of serious events.


As our meals were eaten outdoors on picnic style tables. we always had a few stray dogs running about, ready to pounce on any scraps. One cream colored dog, about the size of a small poodle, attached himself to me and was soon sleeping on my cot at night and accompanying me to the office. He was smart, responsive to my training and attention, becoming a favorite of several of my friends, becoming my pet for several months. This was to end abruptly on Christmas Eve,1945, when Tony Germano and I went in to attend Midnight Mass in Marseille, returning very late to find that my dog was not waiting in our tent as expected. The next hour was spent scouting around with flashlights to see if the dog might have been hit by an Army truck. His disappearance was really puzzling, as he was accustomed to his freedom around the company area, always returning to me and the warmth of our tent. This mystery was cleared up to some extent four months later, at carnival time in Aix-en-Provence, a tale which will be told at a later point. Interesting, though, that each ofmy two Christmases overseas were connected by events involving dogs. (See Appendix)


V-J Day, marking the complete end of World War II, occurred the second week in August, celebrated at Calas Staging Area by the firing of weapons, even a few grenades, that the men had accumulated as personal possessions… really a lot of shooting in the air. As there were some injuries, this led to a massive inspection of each man's foot locker the next day, however, with a large number of weapons, many German souvenirs, being confiscated. Actually there was a lot of, “liberated” stuff around our camp as the temporary units passing through were given stern warnings about not taking anything of that sort aboard ship, resulting in their peddling the stuff to us and to French civilians. In this way I acquired a fine pair or Army binoculars and a small German accordion, which I taught myself to play, providing a bit of jolly music at family gatherings in later years.


V-J Day also resulted in the eventual closing of the three staging areas serving the port. As there was no need to ship units to the Pacific, the Army started redeploying all ofthe troops home through ports in the North, particularly through Le Havre, where thousands of men were processed through Camp Lucky Strike. Our tents weren't folded, however, until the early part of 1946.


When the weather got cold in October we were overrun with field mice, impossible to keep out of our tents. Finally, the Army issued a mousetrap to each man, with Tony Germano and I placing a bet on who could catch the most mice that night. Soon after lights out my trap went off, giving me the task of climbing out of my cozy sleeping bag to bring the trap outside, where I disposed of the mouse in a barrel. I put the trap, which still had some bacon bait left back under my cot. Soon after getting comfortable in my sleeping bag, the trap went off again, causing me to go through the same disposal act as before. I started gloating over the success of my trap, as Tony had caught nothing. I'm ashamed to confess that it took me several mouse-catching episodes later to wise up to the tact that Tony was having a good laugh for his $1 bet, as he had not set his trap, leaving the exterminator's job to me. He kidded me again about my prowess as a mouse catcher when I visited him in Chicago after the war.


My stay at Calas Staging Area also provided some stunning opportunities for traveling in Europe, which I took advantage of at every tum. This included an early trip to Avignon with Tony Germano, with the initial intent to call on a Greek American from Lowell running a hotel, having married and remained in France after the First World War. Another GI friend had stayed at this hotel and told me about the owner upon returning, saying the owner looked forward to meeting me.


This turned out to be a very special weekend. The hotel owner from Lowell would not let us pay for our rooms or meals at the hotel but, to my special pleasure, Tony and I got to spend hours roaming through the Palace of the Popes, a massive fortress where dual popes lived for forty years, challenging the supremacy of the pope in Rome. This was before the return of tourism, of course, and we had the free run of the place, finding massive kitchens, grand receiving rooms, dungeons, extensive ramparts, etc. with great views of the fast-moving river, partially straddled by the “Pont de Avignon,” celebrated in song by every French 1 student, the centuries-old streets, and the wall surrounding it all.


In the months that followed, I got two additional travel vacations, getting a week's leave in each case. The first was to Nice, on the French Riviera, the second to Switzerland. Each was to provide rich experiences which ignited my smoldering travel ember, bringing it to a flame that continues to this day.


France, itself, was still in very rough shape economically, physically, and psychologically, having suffered the blows wrought by the German occupation and defense, to be followed by the mighty Allied military, wreaking havoc wherever they found German resistance. Food and other essentials were strictly rationed, this facilitating a thriving black market in cigarettes, chocolate, blankets, and anything else some enterprising soldiers would find to sell. In 1945 there was no tourism, of course, which made it possible for the Army to negotiate taking over the entire hotel facilities in Nice, even the Casino, which became a Red Cross club, designating the entire city as an R&R facility for enlisted men. Similarly, Cannes, just a few miles away, was taken over for the officers, consistant with the strong Army caste system.


My week's leave in Nice came to an abrupt halt when I developed a very high fever the first night there. My roommate said that I behaved deliriously during the night, causing him to report my condition to the desk without consulting me. Next thing I knew on the following morning was the arrival of two Army medics who, after making a preliminary assessment of my condition, placed me on a stretcher and, in short order, I was once again a patient in a military hospital.


This stay ,which lasted almost two weeks, was really a delight. The hospital had served as a sanitarium for the rich before the war, consisting of stunning buildings and a great tropical garden, statues and all, overlooking the Mediterranean. Apparently, I had contacted some kind of bug which responded to the sulfa drugs provided, so that within days I was feeling fine, having the run ofthe place, including a well stacked Special Services library, spending hours reading amid the luxuriant tropical trees and plantings in the garden. The Army, wisely perhaps, kept me longer than I felt I needed, but there was no complaining from me. The nice part was that they cut orders permitting me to enjoy my initial 7 days in assigning me to the Negresco Hotel, Nice's finest facility on the Rue de Anglais, overlooking the handsome crescent along Nice's waterfront.


I got special pleasure in being given a small private room all to myself; my first in two years of soldiering, relishing the sense of privacy that that bedroom provided. Other memories relate to eating in the Negresco's main dining with every kind of silver piece on the table -- producing a lot of GI speculation as to the purpose of each -- the services of waiters in tuxedos, plus live dinner music. Best of all was what the French chefs were able to create out of standard Anny rations, probably serving the best meals available in France at that time. The Army had wisely contracted to utilize experienced hotel staffs as a boost to the locals, permitting us to taste a slice of life far beyond anything experienced in our civilian days.


I also took advantage of the tours available, seeing the old part ofthe city, the open markets, and an all day trip to Grasse to see how perfume was made from the petals of flowers. Another trip took us to Monaco, touring the Casino, and seeing the spectacular Riviera scenery, traveling on the Grand Corniche, parallel to the ocean, All these sights were to be revisited with the family in the years that followed.


I found my trip to Switzerland over Thanksgiving 1945 almost overwhelming in its sights and delights. As is well known, Switzerland remained neutral throughout the war, escaping the horrors experienced by all of her close neighbors. To cross into a country with its towns and cities intact, its shops full of every kind of goody, the people well dressed, and all of this against a stunning alpine background, was truly awesome… and I made the most ofit. All the touring was done on the excellent Swiss train system, and I saw some of the best that Switzerland had to offer. First stop was Geneva, with a tour of the League of Nations headquarters, followed by two days in Montreux, a resort city on the lake surrounded by towering Alpine peaks.
While there I did some shopping for family Christmas presents (my mother kept the music box I sent her on her bureau until her dying day), but the tour of the Castle of Chillon, followed by a cog railway trip up the Roche de Naye, were the highlights of the entire trip, in my view. The view from the top of the mountain (probably 13,000 or 14,000 ft.) seemed like the top of the world, as we could see Alpine peaks located in Bavaria, Italy, France, and Austria, all covered in white snow and glaciers, jagged massifs poking through. I still have a lot of the black and
white photographs I took that day.


I meant to mention that my traveling companion on that trip was Charlie Monson, a practicing Mormon, but not at all stuffy as a roommate. When we were in Geneva we lucked out in being given an opulent suite in the Grand Hotel, no doubt occupied by diplomats before the war. Talk about living.


Berne, Switzerland's capital was also included on the itinerary, where we saw the well known bear pit and the amazing tower clock, still running after some number of centuries. Berne was memorable in another, more personal, way in that, having placed a phone call home several days before, I was given an appointed time when I could talk to my parents via Atlantic cable. We were limited to three minutes… I can't recall any details of our discussion, but it surely was a wonderful few minutes for this GI who, like the rest ofthe Army, yearned to see his family again.


It was in Berne, also, that Charlie Monson and I accepted an invitation to dinner with a Swiss family, nice folks who spoke English and provided a warm introduction to Swiss life. He was a botanist, and much of the evening was spent in seeing his slides of alpine wildflowers. Though I've forgotten their names, I still remember their address of #7 Cyrostrasse, a recollection that enabled me to re-visit them in later years, introducing them to Rita and our children.


It occurs to me that, despite my contacts with the Chouchards in Marseille, my only dinner invitations were from English and Swiss folks, which is rather symbolic of the French attitude toward Americans.


These travel experiences, plus some which followed, did much, I believe, in whetting my postwar appetite for subsequent European employment and travel with my family in the
1953-63 period. I had been bitten but good.


Little Joe
I first met Little Joe (Pascal Zenier) while at Calas Staging Area, he being one of several wartime waifs who, under dire circumstances usually, attached themselves to various combat units. While not an official policy, the Army seemed tolerant of these arrangements, and the American GI was, typically, generous and sometimes caring, particularly toward children made orphans through wartime actions. Maybe, too, these kids reminded soldiers of their own children or nephews, providing a bit of “family” atmosphere within a rigid military culture.


Little Joe befriended a staff sergeant, apparently a kindly and responsible individual who, upon being redeployed to the states through Marseille, arranged for the boy to be cared for by a French woman until such time as he could arrange for his adoption and subsequent move to the states. It was obvious from the general demeanor and manners of the boy that the sergeant had invested a lot of time and care in his development, his only bad habits being smoking (he was eleven years old) and the occasional use of the four letter words found within GI society. He was very bright, having acquired a fair command of English, fastidious in his personal appearance, and a very engaging young man, at ease within the military setting. His father, a soldier, was killed in the war, while his mother was a casualty of the fighting in their village.


The woman charged with his care, for which she was paid some amount by the sergeant, turned him out on the streets as soon as the sergeant was shipped out, resulting in Joe wisely finding his way to our military post.


There came a day when I and two of my tentmates came across Joe as we returned from lunch, finding him weeping heavily. It seems that, while he had been accepted by one set of tentmates, they were being dispersed, as we all were, to other points due to the coming shutdown of the whole staging area, and no one was coming forth to assume any responsibility for him. We let him bring his stuff over to our tent while we considered  what to do next. Tony Germano and I wound up with the main temporary responsibility for Joe for the next weeks until the camp closed. At that point Tony and I were assigned to different locations, with Little Joe's welfare falling in my lap, and I subsequently took him to my new assignment in Aix-en-Provence, joining the room I shared with Bill Martin (more about Bill and Aix later).


In the following months, I sent several letters to the sergeant who first cared for Joe who, it turned out, was married but childless, living in Missouri. All efforts to contact him were fruitless, and I concluded that he, or maybe his wife, felt different about resuming any responsibility for Joe after a period oftime. (I did reach his wife by phone years later, the sergeant having died, and she claimed to know little about her husband's commitments to Joe).


During this period, Joe became the somewhat pampered mascot of our unit in Aix. He hung around the area, in our room or the Red Cross Club, while I worked, joining with us for meals and accompanying us on trips to Marseille or other places on our time off. I was hopeful, of course, to get him on his way with the sergeant before I myself was returned to the states. This became a bit sticky as my final weeks were looming in sight, our unit itself was breaking up, and the new officers in charge. not having the kind of understanding developed by combat duty, began putting pressure on me to get Little Joe out of the area.


This led to my decision to place him in an orphanage but, upon breaking the news to Joe, he began crying and admitted that he thought he still had family back in Jarny, a coal mining town near Metz. In further consultation with our commanding officer, I was given appropriate written orders to permit my bringing him to Jarny to see what arrangements might be possible. This was a two day trip, a sad one for both ofus, with an overnight stop at a hotel in Dijon, partly traveling by train, the final leg being a jeep, with a driver provided by the post in Metz, a city where I experienced the beginning of my experience in combat many months before.


Little Joe guided us to a house where we found one of his aunts, and I learned that he had an uncle and a brother, both of whom were working in the mine when I arrived. As the loan of the jeep and driver required my prompt return, I sadly left Little Joe in the care of his aunt, who assured me that he would be welcome back in her household. The GI driving the jeep was kind enough to ignore the tears that couldn't be restrained on our return to Metz.


I was glad, though, that Joe seemed pleased to be returned to his family, as well as they to see him, and thus one young man's rather amazing wartime adventure with the U.S. Army came to a close.


There is an epilogue to this story. I maintained sporadic contact with Little Joe in the years that followed, receiving letters in English written by his school teacher, always with the teacher requesting classroom supplies at the same time. Over time I sent a few boxes, but the letters petered out as life went on for both of us until, that is, I was able, along with Rita and our children, to have a reunion with Joe some ten years later upon my being employed as a principal in several schools for dependent Army children in Germany. He was living with his married brother's family in Jarny, where I had brought him years before, and employed as a coal miner. We arrived unannounced, finding him at work deep beneath the earth. I was directed to the manager's office at the mine where he made a phone connection with Joe, far below us. His response was warm indeed, obviously he was amazed to find me in his village and, after the hour or more that it took him to be brought from below, we had a very special reunion.


We visited Joe and his family several times thereafter, with Rita usually bringing clothes that our girls had which were welcomed as they were living under minimal conditions. Later I was transferred to the other side of Germany, and Joe took a new position in a factory in Chamonix, France, where we had our final visit on one of our winter holidays. He was still single and somewhat well-known in amateur soccer circles. We always found him very warm and glad to see us, he doted on our children, and it was good to find that he was making his way successfully in the world.


Going back to our first reunion, I was very touched when, upon our leaving, he put his arm around me and, looking at me through tearful eyes, repeated "Thanks, thank you… thank you," referring to that time when I played a vital role in his young life. Little Joe was now a man and had an appreciation that he may have lacked as a young lad long ago, and I realized more fully that this was one ofthe better chapters in my own life.

If my days in England and Calas Staging Area were great compared to life as a combat infantryman, my final half-year in the Army, spent in Aix-en-Provence was truly halcyon. Upon the closure of Marseille as a major port of embarkation due to the cessation of needing to send troops through the Suez Canal to the Far East, the extensive tent city at Calas, holding up to 70,000 men, was folded away and the massive plain allowed to return to its previous condition… wind blown, desolate, and covered with weeds when I revisited it years later.


Once again my one-semester high school course in typing, plus my experience in the Troop Movement Office at Calas, continued to serve me well, resulting in my assignment as a clerk in the Officers' Records Section of a Graves Registration Unit headquartered in Aix. While administered from there, the unit's real work was done out in the field and at a major laboratory located further north. Its' task was to recover bodies, American, mainly, but also German, French, or any other soldier buried in rural graves all over southern France. Field units would, as a first step, put up posters in several neighboring towns, explaining their mission and giving notice that a team would arrive a few weeks later to interview all who had some knowledge of a buried soldier or airman. Following these interviews, teams of German POW's would disinter the body, bag it, and send it to a regional lab for identification using anything found such as dog tags, dental configurations, etc. Following substantial paperwork, the body would either be returned to the states for burial or to a U.S. military cemetery in Europe, with other bodies transferred to other national jurisdictions.


Despite its grisly, but vital, mission, the headquarters of the unit could not have been in a more attractive and peaceful setting. Aix, being the seat of a university, is a beautiful old town, known in particular for its tree-lined Rue de Maribeau leading down to a large and elaborate fountain in the center of town, one which would rival some of the major fountains at Versailles. Rue de Maribeau is a wide boulevard, completely shaded by two rows of plane trees, and lined with solid French architecture, three stories high, with several excellent sidewalk cafes and restaurants within the fountain area. Its beautiful proportions and classical ambiance continue to attract tourists to this day.


After progressing sequentially from foxhole living, to hospital ward, to 16-man tents, our quarters in Aix appeared fantastic. The entire unit was located in a single seven-story apartment building close to the center of Aix, with our offices on the first two floors, a WAC unit (female Army personnel, mainly black) on the next, non-commissioned officers above them, followed by several floors of GI's (I was on the fourth floor) and, finally, with the top floor assigned to German POW's, who performed many routine duties within the building and in our company mess hall, a prefab erected behind the main building. Our Red Cross Club, our major social center, was also in a prefab to the rear of our headquarters. My room, which must have been a bedroom originally, was furnished with 3 GI cots and 3 footlockers… pretty sparse, but high-class living me, Bill Martin, and Little Joe. Its chief attraction was a small balcony which provided a broad view of many miles, culminating in a great view of Mt. St. Victoire in the distance, a feature of many paintings by Cezanne (who was born in Aix), Gauguin, and many other Impressionist artists.


Our officers' records section was staffed by four persons, the sergeant in charge, myself (now a corporal), Grace (a very nice black WAC), and Odette Rougier, a most capable local lady, in her 30's, with an excellent command of English. The work encompassed all the duties one might expect. ... assignments, pay records, maintaining officers evaluations, etc. While there was enough work to keep one busy, it was a pretty easy assignment once the tasks had been mastered. The personnel were pleasant to be with, our Sergeant, being a combat veteran, had a light supervisory touch, and I could not have had a better assignment, nor a better location, than to be in Aix for my final months of Army life.
A few fond recollections:
If our work for the day was accomplished, Bill Martin, Jim McClinden, or any others who could get off work early, plus Little Joe, could knock off around four thirty for a glass of wine at one of the sidewalk cafes on the tree shaded Rue de Maribeau. One cafe had an excellent instrumental trio consisting of piano, guitar and string bass, which gave us a lot of pleasure. Sooner or later they would play Symphony, Symphony of Love, which was a popular hit, and the pianist was always asked to render DeBussy's Clair de Lune, which I shall always associate with that particular spring in Aix.


D.J. (I think her last name was Anderson) was a truly pretty and vivacious activities director at our Red Cross Club. She was given a lot of attention by the officers of the unit but, interestingly enough, she fell in love with my roommate, Bill Martin. D.J. was loveliness personified, and Bill fell but hard. The two Red Cross girls were housed, along with our officers, across the street from us in the Roy Rene Hotel, a premier facility favored later by Winston Churchill when vacationing and painting in the area. Again, one must cite the unusual kind of Army life we were living after the war, when discipline was relaxed as long as we behaved and fulfilled our responsibilities, and there was a pronounced, but unspoken, comradeship between those officers and enlisted men who were ex-combat infuntry veterans. As Bill and D.J.'s romance grew Bill would sneak over to her room at the Roy Rene (ostensibly very much offlimits to a GI), often returning to our room in the middle of the night. Assuredly, sympathetic night duty personnel at the Roy Rene must have looked the other way. It pleases me to note that Bill became a doctor after the war and married our beautiful Red cross Director.


In keeping with the relaxed military atmosphere, GI's were permitted the use of jeeps and ¾-ton trucks for their personal side trips around the area. One memorable sojourn took us high into the French Alps in an open jeep, with Bill and D.J. up front, while Jim McLinden and I sat in the rear, where we would have frozen if it weren't for our having brought blankets, knowing that we would be traveling into high alpine snowfields.


Another favorite spot, which we visited several times, was Le Baux, a remarkable deserted village dating back to medieval times, perched high above the plain of Avignon.  At that time there was only one occupant in the village; today it is a major tourist attraction, larded with gift shops, small hotels, and restaurants. Still a worthwhile attraction, however, to which we have returned several times in the intervening years.


Though we were now somewhat dispersed, being assigned to assorted units in the area, Tony Germano, Howard Samp, and a few other guys from our Calas days, still got together every once in a while. One time the Army distributed confiscated vodka, a bottle to each enlisted man, this calling for a major party held in our Aix bedroom. Howard brought along some stateside corn for popping, we had grapefruit juice to cut the vodka, and I gave my accordion a real workout. Bill Martin always gave a solo performance of “A Wandering Minstrel, I,” from The Mikado, in which he had performed in a college production. I don't know how it came about, but we wanted to get something out of the neighboring bedroom, which was locked, however. Nothing would do but to cross over from one balcony to the other, four stories up, a sizeable gap between the balconies, with several of us doing it just for the fun of it. Viewing the site of this caper several years later brought home the similarities between our actions and those of any young men, such as fraternity brothers, in another setting.


It was at this time that I made a side trip to visit Harry Wilson, a valued employee in Huntley Hardware, now a sergeant in a medical unit. Harry was always an amiable sort, and we had a good visit, reminiscing about Cupples Square days.


The reader may recall that I lost my devoted pet dog on Christmas Eve of 1945. The story didn't end there, however, as one day toward the end of my stay in Aix, a few of us, including Little Joe, went down to the village center to see the attractions of the carnival setup, the first since before the war. One of the rides was the typical pre-war chain swings suspended from a rotating frame, resulting in the swings spreading wide as the speed increased. We got up in the seats and, just before it started rotating, I was thrilled to see my lost dog in the crowd. I whistled for him and he came running over as the swings started to move. He circled, barking and following beneath me until the speed got too fast, settling for sitting and watching me circling above. At one point he was joined by a rather large matronly woman, who also stood waiting for the ride to stop.
Well, he was all over me once the ride ceased… a most happy reunion. With Little Joe as our somewhat limited interpreter, the lady explained that her husband had brought the dog home on Christmas Eve, having ''won'' him in some kind of a raffle at a bar. The dog was obviously well cared for, his coat was washed and powdered, and he had a kerchief around his neck. Knowing that I would be returning home shortly and could not take him with me, I was pleased to tell the woman that she could keep him, which provided her with considerable relief, as she could plainly see that the dog was mine. Thus, there was a happy ending to this canine tale.


My speculation was that the one disagreeable tentmate we had, a heavy drinker who delighted in teasing the dog meanly, a source of strong words between us, leading to the dog's growling every time he passed my cot, must have deliberately taken the dog out to the bar on Christmas Eve, either giving him away or selling him for drinks. I'll never know for sure, but it does explain his disappearance.


One night D.J. had arranged for a dance with some of the female university students. This was a remarkably chaste affair, the Army transporting them and their two chaperones to the Red Cross Club, with our being lectured ahead of time on our obligations as representatives of the U.S. Army, and no couples allowed to wander outside the club. Doughnuts and Cokes were served, records were played (Glen Miller and other Big Bands), dancing took place, and, sharply at ten, the lovely students and their chaperones were returned to the university, without the opportunity for any private liaisons to develop, which is understandable in view of the general reputation of most GI's. It was nice to have attractive female company, however brief.


It so happened that I was serving as Corporal of the Guard on a day when a GI was being court-martialed for leaving his post while on guard duty at the main entrance to our apartment building. Under certain conditions this could have been a very serious offense, even warranting death in wartime. In his case, he just left for a brief time to join his buddies for a beer someplace, sufficient violation to warrant a finding of guilty and a sentence of six months in an Army stockade, again an example of the Army going easy on combat veterans about to be discharged. My job was to guard the accused during the trial and then to see to his subsequent deliverance to the stockade, limiting his accompanying baggage to clothes and toilet articles only. He happened to have a relatively new edition of Bartlett's Quotations, which he gave to me, a book which has given me many hours of pleasurable browsing and would be the first to be saved in case of a fire. It served me well when I needed an apt quote for a college paper or, on becoming a superintendent of schools, for a speech, serving my children as well and, in view of its history, continuing to be of special value to me.


It was at this time that I was awarded the Bronze Star and, of particular value, my combat infantrymans' badge for combat service. The regular infantry badge was a rifle on a rectangular blue background, while the combat badge had an added circular wreath, making it a very proud possession of all infantrymen who had served under fire.


Barking back to when I was in Metz and required to label and tum in all superfluous personal items before being transported north to the Battle ofthe Bulge, these stored items were returned to me just before returning stateside, including my Brownie camera which contained an expended film. Upon developing I found several pictures of French girls in show-off poses, these within a warehouse setting where, obviously, these goods were stored. Their efforts produced a bit of unexpected entertainment, as was intended.


A disturbing event involved Little Joe and a Lieutenant Griswold, one of our officers who had lost an eye in the Italian campaign. Though Little Joe was a French he bad an Italian name and family background, which was, apparently, noted by the Lieutenant. The Sergeant who had previously cared for Little Joe had an Army uniform cut down to fit him, adorning it with all the same stripes, hash marks, and unit designations contained on his uniform. Unknown to me, this little Italian boy wearing the decorated Army uniform was very offensive to the Lieutenant, no doubt as a result of his combat duty against the Italians, causing him to stop Little Joe as he was going through the chow line, calling for a sharp knife and, in the presence of all the men in the hall, proceeded to strip Little Joe of every adornment sewed on his uniform. Seeing my obvious agitation, the Lieutenant instructed me to “Stay out of this, Corporal,” which I was forced to do under Army rules. To Little Joe's credit, he stood there like a man, tears running down his eyes, suffering gross humiliation. No wonder GI's like myself had little respect for certain officers.


Throughout those months, as in all which came before, I continued to receive letters from home from my most faithful correspondents, weekly letters from my father, almost weekly notes from my Godmother, Auntie Claire, and from Mary Sullivan, a teacher who lived in the Highlands and took it upon herself to write regularly to a number of her former students. The importance of mail from home to a GI cannot be understood fully unless one has had a similar experience. How eager we would be to hear our name called at mailcall.


As spring went along, I began to get very excited about my coming return to the states for discharge, finally receiving my travel orders directing me to report to the port of Marseille for surface transportation back home. What an exciting prospect! My year in southern France was a great experience, one which whetted my appetite for returning with my family in the years which followed. Aix-en-Provence, Le Baux, Marseille, Avignon, Arles, and many other locations all became very familiar to Rita and me, even to have the fun of visiting once again with Odette Rougier, who worked with me in Aix. I shall ever be grateful for those great days… a time of travel, adventure, and wonderment for me.

BACK WHERE I STARTED
My return sailing through the Mediterranean and across the Atlantic to Baltimore could not have contrasted more with my crossing in the other direction a year and a half before. Instead of returning on a troopship, about fifty of us found ourselves in a large space on what, we learned, is called a “sea train,” in that it is especially designed to accommodate rolling rail stock, with tracks within the hold area. In our case, the ship held a number of Large diesel engines which, we were told, were being returned to the United States because of an error in sending over engines with the wrong rail size for European tracks. While this seemed far-fetched, the evidence was there before our eyes as, surely, new engines were not being manufactured in Europe at that time for use in the states. One supposes that in the large scheme of things it is possible for some lower level bureaucrat to make the wrong selection on some complicated shipping document.


In any event, it all worked to our advantage in that we were fed Navy chow, the April weather heading south across the Atlantic was stunning and, with so few of us on board, there was little to do but take a towel and sun ourselves on the deck, wearing only underwear, and reading a good book. I recall observing that the sea was so lakelike that the ship hardly dipped as we crossed through the placid waters.


On the first day out I responded to a call for someone to put out the daily ship's newspaper. This called for an early visit to the bridge to obtain the figures telling us how much progress had been made in the past 24 hours, then to the radio room where I was given a few paragraphs of world news that had been received overnight. Armed with this, plus some canned items made available to me, I would then proceed to type the daily news, usually just a four-page document, which would then be mimeographed and distributed.


While it was fun to play at being an editor in this small way, I got myself in some mild difficulty when I printed an item of my own origin, something I had seen in a magazine some time before. It went like this:


Oh, John, let's not park here.
Oh, John, let's not park.
Oh, John, let's not.
Oh, John, let's!
Oh, John!!
Oh-h-h-h!!!!!!


I guess that the Captain was not a typical navy man, as he had the bridge officer inform me that there would be no more such stuff in the ship's newspaper. “Ay, ay, Sir, no more.”


I don't recall how long we were at sea on this somewhat longer ocean route but, in due time, we sailed into Baltimore harbor on one hot and humid afternoon, though the weather was of no concern to us as we lined the rail, relishing the glimpses of American girls, automobiles, signs in English, and the sight of hard American soil. Broad grins abounded.


After a few days of processing, I then traveled by rail to Ft. Devens, site of my original induction, telephoning my parents planning for their picking me up on the following day, when I would, once again, become a civilian… free of military authority and in charge of my own destiny.


It's rather interesting to note that I had sailed out of New York harbor on October 22nd about eighteen months before, on my mother's birthday and now, on May 6th, I was being welcomed home on Mother's Day. The whole family drove up to Devens on that very, very special day. Home safe, the entire family reunited (Jim having been discharged earlier), I returned to the comfort and security of 539 School Street, thrilled in seeing all that was so very familiar, changed in many ways from the eighteen-year-old who left three years before but happy in anticipation of the life ahead.


The days that followed brought happiness and personal success far beyond what was expected back in May of 1946. Underneath and through the decades, however, this one-time foot soldier has never forgotten what life was like in those bitter woods of Luxembourg......... nor failed to appreciate the luck of it all.
