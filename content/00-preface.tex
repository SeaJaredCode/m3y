With the family making tentative plans a for special 2004 Luxembourg trip to visit the places where I saw combat in the WW\thinspace II Battle of the Bulge. I've been reviewing some of the material I have accumulated in preparation for serving as the guide on this undertaking. My thought was to work up a brief history of that battle and my small part in it, this to serve as background reading prior to next spring's journey but, as I got into it, I started to recall other aspects of my whole experience as a soldier and, finding myself with a lot of free time here in St. Thomas, I decided to expand this into a more complete overview of those times, stretching from autumn 1943 through the spring of 1946\ldots\ my three years. The initial intent can be served, however, by skipping ahead to page \pageref{battle-of-the-bulge}.
