For the next five months, I willingly participated in the Army's well-designed conditioning program whose goal was to convert me from a free and independent civilian to becoming a soldier in every way \ldots\ physically (endless inoculations, dental work, lots of daily drills, weekly hikes, etc), socially (becoming a functioning member of an infantry platoon, adjusting to barracks life with all its different human nuances, gang showers, and toilet facilities, accommodating the rigid dichotomy between officers, non-coms, and plain old GIs like ourselves, learning to go along in order to get along), psychologically (subverting one's natural inclinations and preferences to whatever the Army directs), emotionally (getting over homesickness, accepting some of the Army's brutal approaches, following directions without any questions) and occupationally (acquiring soldierly skills such as close order drill, firing and maintaining my weapon and gas chamber drills, obstacle and bayonet courses, night marches, behavior under fire, etc.) \ldots\ this and much more all combining to enable me and my cohorts to function as properly trained and disciplined soldiers, ones who could and would perform in a predictable way as small, but essential, cogs in a gigantic military machine.

Other recollections of those five months include my learning that southern soil can have a distinctive red color, that one can become extremely fatigued from a 25-mile forced hike with 60-plus pounds of equipment and, on the personal front, acquiring a close friend in Paul Love, a really great guy from a rather privileged (by my standards) background in Pennsylvania. I also earned a few small distinctions along the way. Being extremely thin and wiry, I had the company record for speed in running the obstacle course, I learned that I could be pretty good at firing a rifle, acquiring a badge for excellence, and I also discovered that my innate musical talent served me well in sending Morse code (we were headed toward becoming infantry communications personnel), achieving sending 25 words per minute, which was also the best of our company. This latter accomplishment, which l owe more to genetics than anything else, made me a prime candidate for advanced communications training at the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, which became my next assignment.
