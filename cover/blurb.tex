    \emph{My Three Years in the Infantry, 1943 -- 1946} is one humble infantryman's experience as a cog in
    a big war machine. Dr.\@ Huntley recalls his memoirs in his own original, authentic voice. His story is
    told within the greater historical context that swept him up along with so many who answered the call
    and fought. Told with full awareness of the part that luck played in his story, and a profound
    respect for the heroes who fell before him on the shores of Normandy and around him on the rolling
    farmlands of Luxembourg in the bitter cold in the Ardennes.\\

    His journey was shaped by the seemingly arbitrary machinations of an Army at war. Follow along as
    he is repeatedly reassigned, finds trusted friends, tolerates the occasional officer,
    engages the enemy firsthand, becomes wounded, recovers in the hospital, and makes the most
    of his time after the hostilities conclude. Half a world away from his modest beginnings in Lowell,
    Massachusetts his genuine character and kindness shine through as he adopts a dog, takes on care and
    responsibility for an orphan of the war, and maintains his humor, humility, and perspective throughout
    the whole ordeal.\\
